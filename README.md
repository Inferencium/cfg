<h1>Configuration</h1>
<p>Inference personal configuration files.</p>
<br>
<p>These configuration files are targeting Linux, Gentoo Hardened,<br>
musl libc, and LLVM toolchain. Anything else is out of scope and<br>
unsupported. I am working on moving all GCC-related configurations to LLVM,<br>
and GCC will eventually be dropped, entirely. They also focus on hardening<br>
the system as much as possible, without making it unusable; expect<br>
noticeable performance impact, although the system should still be usable.<br>
Security and privacy are the focuses, nothing else.
